Explanations - 
1. I have cherry picked some relevant words to the topic assigned to me and their stemmed versions are stored in a file named 'relevantWords.txt'. These words are given weights where word like stem(immigration) are given a weight of 4. Some words like Donald Trump, US etc are given weight 1. This system is established in such a way that there are some words which need to co-occur with other relevant words in order to make the document relevant. Hence, from each link, a list of words is generated from the link and the associated anchor text. This list of words are compared with the relevant list of words and a score is generated accordingly. If the link has a greater score than a threshold, it is added to the frontier with it's score.

2. The links in the frontier queue are sorted according to the scores assigned previously
